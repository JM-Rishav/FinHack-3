<br> In this finhack, you will develop a model for the business challenge "Upsell Prediction"</br>
<h2> LTFS Top-up loan Up-sell prediction </h2>
A loan is when you receive the money from a financial institution in exchange for future repayment of the principle, plus interest. Financial institutions provide loans to the industries, corporates and individuals. The interest received on these loans is one among the main sources of income for the financial institutions.
A top-up loan, true to its name, is a facility of availing further funds on an existing loan. When you have a loan that has already been disbursed and under repayment and if you need more funds then, you can simply avail additional funding on the same loan thereby minimizing time, effort and cost related to applying again.
LTFS provides it's loan services to its customers and is interested in selling more of its top-up loan services to its existing customers so they have decided to identify when to pitch a top-up during the original loan tenure.
If they correctly identify the most suitable time to offer a top-up, this will ultimately lead to more disbursals and can also help them beat competing offerings from other institutions.
